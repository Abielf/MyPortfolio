 ###About Me:

 experience in the hospitality industry as a night auditor and front desk clerk. Programming languages include Java with 
 a focus on object-oriented-programming and unit testing, as well as SQL. Exposure to Python, Kubernetes, Angular, and 
 Agile. 

 ###Projects:
 * **Haphaestus-frontend:** A React application simulating a blog archive deployed in Heroku and stylized using 
   bootstrap. Connects to a backend database using Axious. Currently able to generate new posts, view existing posts, 
   navigate the post archives and filter by tag. Looking to implement new tag generation in near future.

 * **Haphaestus-frontend:** A database made using spring, JDBC, and H2. Will be migrating to PostGres in the near 
   future. Contains dozens of dummy articles to show current MVC functionality.

 * **Flash Cards:** A flash card app made for the purposes of technical interview preperation. Written in React, 
   deployed in Heroku. Contains 240 terms pre-loaded in a JSON array. Looking to update this in the future with 
   Bootstrap for more engaging visuals; and to update general functionality and allow the user to upload questions/decks.

 * **Mars-Lander:** Implementation of the "Mars Lander" assignment efficient enough to earn a 'Coding Dragon' award from 
   Zip Code. A personal favorite among my projects, as it allowed me to leverage my mathematical abilities while 
   refactoring code.
